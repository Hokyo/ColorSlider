## Installation

### Carthage

1. Add the following to your *Cartfile*:

```
github "Hokyo/ColorSlider"
```
2. You have two options:
    1. Either Run `carthage update` and add the framework as described in [Carthage Readme](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application)
    2. Or use a very convenient [auto-build script](https://github.com/k-lpmg/xcode-build-script-for-carthage) that adds the newly built framework to your Xcode project automatically

### CocoaPods

1. Add the following to your *Podfile*:

```
pod 'ColorSlider', :git => 'https://github.com/Hokyo/ColorSlider.git', :tag => '1.1.1'
```

2. Run `pod install`.
